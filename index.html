          <h2>Member of Parliament of Rajya Sabha for Bombay State</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>
            (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist,
            social reformer and political leader who headed the committee
            drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly
            debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of
            Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after
            renouncing Hinduism. Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College,
            University of Bombay, and studied economics at Columbia University
            and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and
            1923 respectively and was among a handful of Indian students to have
            done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in
            the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an
            economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his
            political activities; he became involved in campaigning and
            negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals,
            advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and
            contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of
            India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass
            conversions of Dalits.[14] In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's
            highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The
            salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours
            him. He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb (BAH-bə
            SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".
